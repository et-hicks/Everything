## Everything.h

This is the header file if you run the following command

`
find / -name '*.h' -exec echo \#include \"'{}'\" \; > everything.h
`

All credit goes to [reddit user jarfil](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyprogramming/comments/ic8e56/this_is_how_i_do_includes/g245egy/) for making the script, I just ran it. 

Anytime you need to use a library, just use them all and dont think about it. 

Seriously, just dont think about it.
